# PCA_Shiny

R/shiny app for PCA (including projected PCA)

## 1. Installation
To run the EBSeq graphical user interface (GUI), it requires the following packages: shiny, shinyFiles, EBSeq

R version â‰¥ 3.0.0 is needed. For mac user, make sure whether xcode is installed.

To install the shiny and EBSeq packages, in R run:

install.packages("shiny")

install.packages("shinyFiles")

> source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

> biocLite("EBSeq")

Or install locally.

### Run the app
To launch GUI, in R run:

> library(shiny)

> runGitHub('jeeachoi/PCA_Shiny')

## 2. Input files

The first input file is a expression matrix. 
Rows are the genes and columns are the samples/cells. Row names and column names are required in the input file.
Currently the program only takes csv files or tab delimited file.
The input file will be treated as a tab delimited file if the suffix is not '.csv'.
For the "Projected PCA", this entry of input data file will be used as the 'reference file' (e.g. Bulk RNA-seq) - the program will calculate PCs using this data set and project the 2nd input file on these PCs.

The second input file is a expression matrix. This is needed only if a user wants to perform projected PCA. If projected PCA is specified, the script will generate PCs using the data file from the first file (e.g. Bulk RNA-seq), and generate projected PCA plots for the second data (e.g. scRNA-seq). Note that when calculating PCs from the first file, only the common genes in both files are used.

The last input file is a condition vector for different coloring.
If the file is not provided, all samples will be considered to be one condition, and output figures will contain single color.
The conditions could be time points, spatial positions, etc. The csv or tab delimited file formats are acceptable. The file should contain 1 column.
For regular PCA, each element of the condition vector file should represent the corresponding condition that each cell belongs to, which matches the order of columns in the expression matrix (input file 1) with the same length. For projected PCA, conditions should correspond to columns in the 2nd expression matrix (input file 2).

### Example files
Example input files for PCA: **BulkRNADataMat.csv**, **BulkCondVec.csv** and example input files for projected PCA: **BulkRNADataMat.csv**, **scRNADataMat.csv**, **ScCondVec** could be found at https://github.com/jeeachoi/PCA_Shiny/tree/master/example_data   

## 3. Customize options

- Need normalization? If Yes, Median-by-ratio normalization will be performed. If the input matrix is normalized (e.g. by median-by-ratio normalization or TMM), this option should be disabled. In addition, if the input expression matrix only contains a small set of genes, it is suggested to normalize using all genes first before taking the subset.
- Adjust outlier? If Yes, values <= 5 th quantile (>= 95 th quantile) will be pushed to 5 th quantile (95 th quantile). 
- Lower limit of detection threshold? Default is 0. Genes with max expression below this threshold will be removed. 
- Projected PCA? If Yes, PCs will be generated using the first input file, and projected PCA plots will be generated for the second input file.
- Number of PCs to output? (define it as k, default k = 5).
- Plot biplot (biplot shows genes with samples together)? If Yes, biplot will be generated. Nor recommended if the number of samples and genes are large.
- Plot scree plot (variance explained plot)? 
- PCA plot with different coloring by conditions?
- Output directory, error will occour if not set.
- 1. Output file name for biplot (pdf)
- 2. Output file name for scree plot (pdf)
- 3. Output file name for pairwise transformed data plot (pdf)
- 4. Output file name for percentage of SD explained by each PC (csv)
- 5. Output file name for gene loading for the top k PCs (csv)
- 6. Output file name for sorted gene loading for the top k PCs (for each of the top k PCs, genes are sorted by their absolute loadings in each PC)
- 7. Output file name for input parameters (txt) 
- If projected PCA is performed, output 4-6 is obtained using the first input file

## 4. Outputs
One to three pdf files and three csv files will be generated:
- Biplot.pdf: This file will be generated only when the user choose to plot biplot. Biplot maps a data matrix by plotting both the rows and columns in the same figure. Here the genes are arrows and samples/cells are points.
- Screeplot.pdf: This file will be generated only when the user chooses to plot scree plot. The x-axis shows the number of PCs and y-axis shows variance explained. 
- TransformedData_Plot.pdf: The pairwise plot between k PCs are shown. The first 2 PC plots with condition label is also provided.
- Gene_loading.csv: Gene loading for the top k PCs are shown.
- SortedGene_loadings.csv: For each of the top k PCs, genes are sorted by their absolute loadings in each PC.
- Variance_explained.csv: Percentage of SD explained by each PC.
- PCA_info.txt: This file contains all input parameters.
## Note
User should select a "Output Folder" in the GUI
